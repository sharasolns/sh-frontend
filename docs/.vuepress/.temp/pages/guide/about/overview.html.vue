<p>This project was inspired by the need to have a collection of components and utilities that can be used to build web applications.
While working on different projects, we found ourselves repeating the same code over and over again Such as form components, sweet alerts, and other utilities. This was time-consuming and not efficient.
We decided to create a collection of components and utilities that I can use to build web applications. This is how shFramework was born.</p>
<p>After using it for a while, we decided to share it with the community. We believe that it will help other developers to build web applications faster and more efficiently.
Also to help in the development of the package, we have created a <RouteLink to="/guide/contribution.html">contribution guide</RouteLink> to help in the development of the package.
We are open to contributions and suggestions to make the package better.</p>
<p>Let's build a better web application together.</p>
